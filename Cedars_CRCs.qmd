## [How's It Going?]{style="font-weight:500"}

Are CRCs effective at reducing the use of emergency services for non-urgent matters while ensuring that homeless patients can access their basic needs?

 

Data gathered in fulfilling SB1152 needs used to measure role's impact

## [Studying the Impact]{style="font-weight:500"} {.smaller}

-   Diff-in-diff cohort model

    -   Visit rates of patients experiencing homelessness

    -   Split by whether they were seen by a CRC during their index visit

-   Dependent variables

    -   Time interval between visits (in days)

    -   Cost of stay

    -   Length of stay (LOS)

-   Differences in the populations were tested for statistical significance using a Welch's t-test

## [What We Found]{style="font-weight:500"} {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   A two-sample t-test demonstrated statistical significance (p = 0.0014)

-   22.82% increase to \# of days elapsed before a patient returned to the ED after visiting with a CRC

-   95% confidence interval: 2.6-10.9 days larger gap between ED visits

**Revisit rate:**

:arrow_down:35%

**95% CI:**

0.8-1.4 fewer visits

## [Other Results]{style="font-weight:500"} {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Difference in cost of care

    -   p = 0.1050

    -   Not statistically significant

-   Difference in length of stay in the ED

    -   p = 0.0150

    -   Not statistically significant

-   Makes sense considering CRC can't really affect those figures

## [Understanding the Results]{style="font-weight:500"} {.smaller}

-   Increased gap between ED visits

-   Lowered rate of ED visits over 90 and 180 days

-   Implications

    -   Increased utilization of community resources may be decreasing frequency of needs that draw patients experiencing homelessness to ED

    -   Reduced burden by lower-urgency needs on ED resources

-   Possible effects

-   Shorter wait times

-   Fewer patients leaving without being seen

-   Greater focus on other patients with more acute needs

## [Beyond the First Year ...]{style="font-weight:500"} {.smaller}

-   Slides so far showed Feb 2020-Jan 2021, but the work continues.

-   Results Feb 2020-Jun 2022

    -   16,166 visits by 14,161 PEH patients
